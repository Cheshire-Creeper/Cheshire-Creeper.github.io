<h2>
THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING
</h2>

<img src="Square_Thumbnail.jpg" alt="A man without a face, with a hat on. He's Pale White. He is not Slenderman. He was never Slenderman. Carry on.">

<p>The cornerstone of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8guK9MliQSCiXPO8baJSqg">Cheshire Creeper Channel</a>, "The Events of the Evening" is about a Radio Station in a small town full of...let's say "quirky" people.
The story is narrated through the medium of radio, specifically that of a radio drama, a genre I have a fling with.</p>

<h2>
CHESHIRE CREEPER REVIEWS.
</h2>

<p>Cheshire Creeper Channel also has a very snarky show called "Cheshire Creeper Reviews!" I tried to do a storyline, but that's hard to do when it comes out not often.</p>

<h2>
THE TRUTH UNIT.
</h2>

<p>YES! This actually warrants a section. This show can be summed up in 5 words: "Sitcom about Illumatni Office Workers." We are actually in the process of making Episode 2,
"Coffee Breakers." I hope to see you all there!</p>

<h2>
SEQUENTIAL
</h2> 
<p>This is a segment that also exists, though it is non-fiction, meaning it is harder to write. I will be doing an episode about the 2016 presidential election, though. Look out for that!</p>
