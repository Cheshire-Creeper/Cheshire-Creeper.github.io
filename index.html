Nothing but the wind.
</h1>

<p>The man came along a winding road. Thorton was near, he knew.
"BROADWAY'S DARK TONIGHT! LITTLE BIT WEAKER THAN YOU USED TO BE!"
Well, he knew now. He knew where Thorton Was.
"BROADWAY'S DARK TONIGHT! SEE THE OLD MAN SITTING IN THE OLD MAN'S BAR, WAITING FOR HIS TURN TO <strong>DIEEEEEEE!"</strong>
He was right beside him, floating on the road. Of course he floated: He didn't know.</p>
