	<li>Q: Why are you doing this?</li>
	<li>A: I feel like this is the best way to get my stories and thoughts to you, the internet.</li>

	<li>Q: Okay, so when does The Truth Unit Episode 2 come out?</li>
	<li>A: The Truth Unit Episode 2 will come out soon. I just need to do the voices. The Episode will not be animated, but you can animate it yourself!</li>
