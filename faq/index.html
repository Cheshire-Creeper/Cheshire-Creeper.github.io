	<li>Q: Why are you doing this?</li>
	<li>A: I feel like this is the best way to get my stories and thoughts to you, the internet.</li>
	<li>Q: When do you post videos?</li>
	<li>A: I don't exactly know. The Events of The Evening was once a month, but I've cut it down to "whenever I feel like it."</li>
	<li>Q: Okay, so when does The Truth Unit Episode 2 come out?</li>
	<li>A: The Truth Unit Episode 2 will come out soon. I just need to do the voices. The episode will not be animated, but you can animate it yourself!</li>
